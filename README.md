# Design Patterns Project

This project is a demonstration of various design patterns implemented in Java. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design. By incorporating these patterns into your codebase, you can improve code clarity, maintainability, and scalability.

## Implemented Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Builder Pattern**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter Pattern**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an existing class with a new interface.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Adds behavior to objects dynamically without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
- **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer Pattern**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
