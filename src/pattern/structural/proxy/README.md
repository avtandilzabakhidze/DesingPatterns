a substitute or placeholder for another object.

allowing you to perform something either before 
or after the request gets through to the original object.
a)remote 
b)virtual 
c)protection

examples:
1. Remote Proxy for Network Connection
   Suppose you have a network connection that might be costly to establish. 
   You can use a proxy to manage the connection.
2. Protection Proxy for Access Control
   Suppose you have an object with sensitive information that should be 
   accessed only by authorized users. You can use a proxy to control access.
