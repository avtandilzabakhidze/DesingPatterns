Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose
objects into tree structures and then work with these
structures as if they were individual objects.

examples:
1. Organization Hierarchy
    Suppose you want to represent an organization's hierarchy,
    which includes departments, teams, and employees.
    The Composite pattern can be used to represent this hierarchical structure.
2. File System Structure
   Another common example of the Composite pattern is representing file system 
   structures where directories can contain files or other directories.
