Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface
to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

examples:
1.  Facade for a Computer
    Consider a computer system with multiple components.
    The Facade pattern can simplify interactions with these components.
2. Facade for a Hotel Booking System
   Suppose you have a hotel booking system with multiple subsystems. 
   A Facade can simplify the interaction with these subsystems.
