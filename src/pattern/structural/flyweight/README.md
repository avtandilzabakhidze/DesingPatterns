Flyweight is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects
into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state
between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.

examples:
1. Text Formatting with Flyweight Pattern
   Suppose you have a text editor that uses a lot of characters,
   and many of these characters are repeated. You can use the 
   Flyweight pattern to reuse common characters to save memory.
2. Flyweight Pattern for Music Notes
   Consider a music application where you have a lot of notes 
   being played, and many of these notes are repeated.
3. StringPool
