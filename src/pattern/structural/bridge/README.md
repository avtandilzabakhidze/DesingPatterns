Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large 
class or a set of closely related classes into two separate
hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed
independently of each other.

examples:
1. Shape Drawing
    Consider a scenario where you have different shapes (circle, square, etc.)
    that you want to draw using various rendering techniques
    (e.g., using a vector or raster renderer). The Bridge pattern helps to
    separate the shape from its rendering.
2.  Remote Controls
    Consider a remote control system for electronic devices (TV, radio) 
    that need to work with different types of brands and models.
