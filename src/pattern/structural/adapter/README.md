Adapter (wrapper) is a structural design pattern that allows objects
with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

examples:
1. Legacy System Adapter
   Suppose you have a legacy system with an old interface that
   needs to be adapted to work with a new system.
2. Adapter for Different Media Players
   Consider a scenario where you have different media players
   with their own interfaces that need to be adapted to a common MediaPlayer interface.
