Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you
attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects
inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
(wrap this obj another onj in runtime)

examples:
1.  Text Formatting
    Suppose you have a text editor application that allows basic
    text formatting. You want to extend its functionality to support 
    additional formatting options using the Decorator pattern.
2. Coffee Order
   Building upon the previous Coffee Order example:
   Suppose you have a coffee ordering system that allows for different 
   combinations of additives like milk, sugar, and flavorings.
