Memento is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.

examples:
1. Text Editor with Undo Functionality
   Consider a text editor that supports undo functionality by using the Memento pattern to save and restore the editor's state.
2. Game State Management
   Consider a game that needs to save and restore the state of the game at different checkpoints using the Memento pattern.
