Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

examples :
1. Purchase Approval Process
   Consider an example where purchase requests need approval based on their amount. The approval authority is divided among managers based on the purchase amount.
2. Logging System
   Consider a logging system where log messages need to be handled based on their severity levels.
