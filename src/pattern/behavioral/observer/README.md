Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

examples:
1.  Weather Station
    Consider a weather station that provides weather updates to multiple display units. When the weather changes, all the display units should be notified and updated with the latest weather information.
2. Stock Market Updates
   Consider a scenario where multiple stock market traders need to be notified when the stock prices change.
