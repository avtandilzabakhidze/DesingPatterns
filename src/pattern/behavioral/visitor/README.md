Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.

examples:
1.  Shopping Cart with Discounts
    Consider a shopping cart system where you have different types of items (e.g., regular items, discounted items) and want to apply different discount algorithms to calculate the total price.
