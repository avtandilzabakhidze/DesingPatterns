Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object.

examples:
1.  Chat Room Application
    Consider a chat room application where users can send messages to each other within a group chat. The Mediator pattern can be used to facilitate communication between users in the chat room.
