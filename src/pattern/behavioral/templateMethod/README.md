Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

examples:
1. Coffee and Tea Preparation
   Consider a scenario where you have different beverages (coffee and tea) that have similar steps in their preparation but might have some variations.
