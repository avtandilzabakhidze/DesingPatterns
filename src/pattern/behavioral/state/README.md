State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

examples:
1. Fan Controller
   Consider a scenario where you have a fan with different states (Off, Low, Medium, High) and you want to control its speed based on these states.
